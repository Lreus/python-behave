# python-behave
While studying [Behave documentation](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), I build this repository to save my 
commented tests.

This repository does not provide new functionnalities to behave but it might help you get a quick understanding
on how to use this great tool.

Feel free to leave comments and suggestions I'm always happy to learn.
